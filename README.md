## Overview
Our analysis is our way of analyzing data to determine where and when to open up a surf shop in Hawaii, looking at various trends in temperature and precipitation to see if the Surf Shop that is also Ice Cream Shop can survive 12 months out of the year in Hawaii
## Results
- The maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees, 83 in December, which is not too hot for outdoor activities and perfect for ice cream
- The minimum temp in June was 64 degrees, 56 in December, slightly chilly for ice cream, but could still be okay for both surfing and Ice Cream
- The December Temps are on average 4 degrees lower with a similar max(83) and a min of 56, yet the 25th percentile of 69 shows that it is almost all of the time going to be a comfortable outside temperature
## Summary
I believe because of the moderate weather in Hawaii, and the temperatures given for June and December, that the business, though generally it may seem as a summer business, could survive year-round because Hawaii never gets really cold. And because ice cream is always good no matter the weather.
